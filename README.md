# Multiple-testing-via-multivariate-HMM
mvLIS is a program to carry out multiple testing via multivariate hidden Markov models, which is written in R code. Here mvLIS program models the temporal or one-dimensional sequential dependence structure among tests via a Markov chain and incorporates auxiliary information via multi-dimensional summary statistics.
